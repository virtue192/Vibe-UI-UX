**Turn “I want it to feel like this” into a visible, adjustable design brief you can hand to a coding assistant.**

[Website](https://vibe-design-labs.github.io/Vibe-UI-UX/) · [Try the studio](https://vibe-design-labs.github.io/Vibe-UI-UX/studio.html) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

**v0.5.1.0.0 · 75 design entries · 75 dedicated preview templates · 5 local recipe families · MIT + OFL**

New: a unified cream / olive interface, an effect plaza, real pending submissions, and a submission workflow. A branch push is not a production deployment. See the [plaza guide](docs/COMMUNITY_PLAZA.md) and [release boundaries](docs/RELEASE_0.5.1.0.0.md).

Workbench update: immutable candidates, comparison, local projects, shared constraints, 8 integration cases, a consumer Skill, controlled compositions and four task fragments. This is a local implementation, not yet deployed. See the [workbench guide](docs/WORKBENCH_GUIDE.md) and [verification boundaries](docs/RELEASE_0.5.0.0.0.md).


[![Real studio capture: leaf cursor, warm spotlight, click ripple and staggered reveal](docs/media/effects.gif)](https://vibe-design-labs.github.io/Vibe-UI-UX/studio.html?item=custom-cursor)

Captured from the project’s actual renderers, without AI-generated frames. The GIF is a recording; the [live studio](https://vibe-design-labs.github.io/Vibe-UI-UX/studio.html) supports interaction, parameter tuning and reduced-motion preferences.

## Ask the model to write a new effect

1. Connect TokenDance, describe a specific interaction, and choose **Ask AI to code a new effect**. The model writes HTML, CSS and JavaScript instead of choosing a catalog template.
2. Test the isolated preview, change its declared parameters, and inspect the actual source. A failed preview is reported and cannot be submitted for inclusion.
3. Export the **Web source ZIP** and run `python -m http.server 4180`, or save the effect JSON and import it later to restore the same code and values. Tuning and export make no model calls.
4. Submit for a review PR, consent to publishing the code under MIT, then confirm the issue on GitHub. The bot creates an isolated data PR without running submitted code. Maintainer review and manual merge remain required.

Newly generated code exports native Web projects in this release; the five existing templates retain React/video exports. Diagnostics distinguish no response, truncated output, invalid JSON, failed validation and preview errors. No automatic paid retries. The maintainer confirmed a real generated preview for the paper-valley brief using their own key; visual fidelity and each interaction still need human review. [Contract and limits](docs/GENERATED_EFFECTS.md) (Chinese).

Before generating, check **Active model** in the studio. Changes apply immediately; each request sends that exact ID without fallback models. Generation streams reasoning/code progress. Kimi K3 (`kimi-k3`) uses `high` reasoning and JSON mode. The app omits `max_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens` and imposes no prompt, generated source or JSON-import length cap. The selected service owns its defaults and limits. There is no overall deadline while data arrives; initial response wait is 150s and idle timeout is 120s, with manual cancellation. Failed generation never presents an old library template as new output.

The **Model call receipt** compares the requested ID with the upstream model field. A different recognized catalog ID is rejected. An unknown upstream label stays unconfirmed, without being renamed K3; valid code can still preview. A missing label also stays unconfirmed. Copy diagnostics without the key, prompt, source or reasoning text, and compare them with TokenDance logs. Matching reported IDs do not independently prove internal routing. [Fix verification and limits](docs/RELEASE_0.4.4.0.2.md) (Chinese).

If developer tools are unavailable, use the [key-free connection check](https://vibe-design-labs.github.io/Vibe-UI-UX/connection-check.html): public catalog plus an empty unauthenticated request, with a sanitized report and no model generation. It cannot verify the model or billing of a previous call.

The connection panel also reads [recent usage](docs/TOKENDANCE.md) on click: one read-only GET for up to 20 account calls over 24 hours, without generation or automatic pagination. Copied reports keep model, provider, time and trace IDs; account, key names and costs are omitted. A sample alone does not prove a previous call’s model.

## What is IntentKit?

Describing the feeling is often the hardest part of vibe coding. Does “lighter” mean a smaller hover lift, a scale change, or more whitespace? IntentKit connects everyday expressions with UI/UX terminology, aliases, examples and concrete parameters so designers, developers and newcomers can agree on what to build.

Design Compiler follows **everyday language → editable understanding (Design IR) → controlled recipe → real preview → design brief / Agent brief / JSON**. It helps you inspect a design proposal; recipe mode stays within known implementations. The new AI code mode runs one model-authored effect in an isolated frame, rather than building a whole site.

| Feature | Available now |
| --- | --- |
| Design library | 75 searchable entries, curated aliases, definitions, usage guidance and source links |
| Effect studio | 75 corresponding templates, validated parameters, briefs, JSON export and shareable single-effect links |
| Design Compiler | 5 local recipe families: gentle lift, warm glow with lift, press feedback, staggered entry and click ripple |
| Custom cursor | 8 shapes; configurable color, size, following and click feedback, plus independent spotlight settings |
| Languages | Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean and German interface; README languages switch via the links above |
| Optional AI | Your own TokenDance connection for intent parsing and known-effect suggestions |

## First run: no key needed

1. Open the [studio](https://vibe-design-labs.github.io/Vibe-UI-UX/studio.html) and choose English in the top-right language selector.
2. Click **Try locally → Gentle card lift**, or enter `The card should lift gently on hover, not too much` and click **Interpret & match recipes**. Without a configured key, it uses local rules.
3. Review the understanding and expand the editable fields to correct target, trigger and strength. Defaults and inferences are listed separately from your stated intent.
4. Hover over the card and adjust the parameters. Preview, brief and recipe use the same final values. If an adjustment conflicts with the intent, review the warning and explicitly accept the current parameters.
5. Copy the **Agent brief** from the compiler output into your coding assistant, or export the **compilation JSON**. The original right-hand JSON export remains a separate **single-effect export**.

For terminology lookup, search `frosted glass`, `backdrop-filter` or a known alias in the sidebar. **Every public entry has a corresponding preview.** Styles show distinct materials and layouts, motion entries show real movement, dashboards use clearly labeled synthetic data, and UX principles demonstrate tasks and states. There is no generic concept placeholder. See the [dedicated-preview contract](docs/PREVIEW_SCENES.md) (Chinese).

## Reuse an effect in your project

**Five templates export runnable Web, React component / hook, and video project ZIPs**: spotlight with lift, hover lift, press feedback, click ripple, and staggered entry. Only the spotlight layer uses WebGL; other motion uses DOM.

1. Select one of these effects and tune it. Confirm any Compiler conflict before exporting.
2. Choose a target under Component code and download, or open the standalone example to compare parameters and scripted frames.
3. Web: unzip and run `node serve.mjs`, with no dependencies. React: integrate into your React 18/19 project. Video: run `npm install`, then `npm run render`.
4. To save parameter changes, edit `effect.json` and run `node sync-export.mjs` to refresh JSON, brief, and manifest. The other 70 entries do not export placeholder code.

[Integration details and verification limits](docs/WEB_COMPONENTS.md) (Chinese). No API key is needed; video is a four-second scripted demonstration. This version is delivered through a review PR; the public site updates after manual merge and deployment.

## Optional AI with TokenDance

1. Click **Connect TokenDance**. The panel loads the public model catalog; this does not call a model.
2. Authorize through the TokenDance popup to create a key, or paste your own existing key from [TokenDance keys](https://tokendance.space/keys). Authorization creates a key after your confirmation.
3. Choose a chat-compatible model and click **Keep in this page**. If the catalog fails to load, enter an official model ID manually.
4. With a configured key, only an explicit click on **Find effects** **Interpret & match recipes**, or **Ask AI to code a new effect** requests a model; TokenDance bills usage. The five local examples remain local even when connected.
5. Use **Forget key** to disconnect. **Keys stay in page memory and clear on refresh**. There is no account system or key storage in localStorage, sessionStorage, the repository or GitHub Secrets. The language preference can be saved.

GitHub Pages connects directly from your browser to TokenDance; local/server hosting uses the current instance’s relay. Enter keys only in trusted deployments. Recipe parsing can fall back to local rules; original-code generation reports failures without substituting an old template or retrying paid requests. The maintainer confirmed a real generated preview; other models and scenarios need separate verification. See [integration details and test limits](docs/TOKENDANCE.md) (Chinese).

## Run your fork locally

Requires **Node.js 20+**; content checks and source packaging additionally use **Python 3**. There are no npm dependencies and no key is needed to start.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vibe-Design-Labs/Vibe-UI-UX.git
cd Vibe-UI-UX
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4173/studio.html](http://localhost:4173/studio.html). Substitute your fork’s URL when cloning. After changing source files, stop and restart the development server to rebuild.

Validate and reproduce static hosting:

```sh
npm test
npm run check:content
npm run check:docs
python scripts/package-source.py
npm run build:pages
npm run preview:pages
```

Static preview: [http://localhost:4174/Vibe-UI-UX/](http://localhost:4174/Vibe-UI-UX/). Deployable output: `dist/pages/`. Use python3 where python is unavailable. Building, checking and packaging do not call a model.

## Publish your own GitHub Pages site

1. Fork this repository and enable Actions in your fork.
2. Choose **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**.
3. Run **Actions → Deploy GitHub Pages → Run workflow** for the first deployment.
4. After it succeeds, use the actual URL from Pages settings or the deployment output. Later pushes to main deploy automatically.

Relative paths support repository subpaths and forks. **No model key or GitHub Secret is required**: each visitor connects their own TokenDance account/key. [Full deployment guide](docs/GITHUB_PAGES.md) (Chinese).

## Maintain entries, recipes and effects

Give the [maintenance skill](skills/ui-ux-content-maintainer/SKILL.md) to any AI that can read/write files, or edit by hand. Add a JSON file in `content/items/` when using an existing template; a new renderer also requires registry and renderer changes. See [recipe maintenance](skills/ui-ux-content-maintainer/references/compiler-recipes.md).

Run `npm run check:content`, `npm test` and `npm run check:docs`; rebuild [font subsets](docs/FONTS.md), the source archive and Pages when needed. The scripts need no GPT key or model quota; another AI provider may charge for its own service. [Maintenance guide](docs/CONTENT_MAINTENANCE.md) (Chinese).

| Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `content/items/` | Entries, aliases, localized text, sources and review status |
| `previews/registry.json` + `public/previews.js` | Parameter contracts and controlled renderers |
| `compiler/` + `public/compiler-*.js` | IR, multilingual expressions, recipes, validation and compiler UI |
| `public/` | Static website, studio, translations and TokenDance connection |
| `server/worker.js` | Optional local/Worker relay; not required by GitHub Pages |
| `.github/workflows/pages.yml` | Validation, packaging, build and deployment |

## Submit from the studio

For the five supported effects, click **Submit a review PR**. Add a title, use case, optional attribution and source, then confirm public MIT contribution. On GitHub, click Submit new issue; repository automation opens a review PR with the case JSON and replies with its link. No manual fork, installation or GitHub API token.

After maintainer review and manual merge, the case appears in the [community gallery](https://vibe-design-labs.github.io/Vibe-UI-UX/community.html) with an actual preview and export. Submitting never writes main or deploys. [User and maintainer guide](docs/COMMUNITY_PR.md) (Chinese). Automation becomes active after this workflow is merged into main and Actions may create PRs.

## Community contributions and credits

Parameter cases: **studio → GitHub confirmation → automated review PR → maintainer review → manual acceptance**. New code uses ordinary fork / PR contributions; private discussion is optional. Contributors may credit their own cases; passing checks does not approve a merge. Ordinary bugs without private information can be reported in Issues.

[Contributor guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) · [AI guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING_AI.md) · [Case submission form](docs/contributions/TEMPLATE.md) · [Credits index](docs/contributions/README.md). These detailed guides are currently in Chinese. The [extension, reusable-code and multi-platform plan](docs/COMMUNITY_ROADMAP.md) describes future work, not released features.

## Current limits

- Most entry text is Chinese/English draft content. Japanese, Korean and German bodies explicitly fall back to English. Five interface languages do not imply five reviewed knowledge collections.
- Local rules cover five recipe families, not arbitrary design intent. Ambiguous or unsupported requests list unresolved details. Cross-template composition, springs and automatic mapping of exact numbers in sentences are not supported yet.
- Structural validation does not certify facts, sources or translations. Strict publication review intentionally fails while drafts remain. Unread WeChat article text was not fabricated as a consulted source.
- Previews illustrate concepts and do not save real data. Review exports before implementation. Reduced motion, touch and keyboard interactions are handled separately.
